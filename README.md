# Project Plan

## Interface with Discord Bot
Step 1:
- Can create a cat via the bot
- Can create pennett square with two cats to see their possible offspring
- Create pictures of cat (We can use emojis/reacts via discord)
- None of this will be saved, you can just run this while you are using once it shuts off, the data is lost.
Step 2:
- Save cat data to SQL database

## Cat Genes
- Add stripes
- Add white spots gene
- Add eye colors (Maybe)
- Maybe add color point gene
