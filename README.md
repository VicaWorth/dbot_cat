# Project Plan

## Interface with Discord Bot
Step 1:
- [X] Can create a cat via the bot
- [X] Can create pennett square with two cats to see their possible offspring
- [ ] Can check if a certain gene is possible with a pairing
- [ ]  Create pictures of cat (We can use emojis/reacts via discord)
- [ ] 
-  None of this will be saved, you can just run this while you are using once it shuts off, the data is lost.
Step 2:
- [ ]  Save cat data to SQL database

## Cat Genes
Genes
- [X] Add stripes
- [X] Add white spots gene
- [X] Add eye colors (Maybe) <-- polygenes make this impossible unless we wanna do some kind of statistics
- [X] Maybe add color point gene
- [ ] Add fur length gene
- [ ] Add a size gene (if exists)


## Optimization
- [ ] Fix the punnett square generator to be based off of loops rather than manual
